This program was created out of frustration of having to do a volume of 
calculations that could warrent a spreadsheet but having to check how many 
significant figures each answer needed for OSU's BIOC 3723-BIOCHEMICAL 
LABORATORY.

This is written in javascript and designed for google docs spreadsheet 
but could also work with open office. 

When this project is finished we will have functions to. 
a. Get the number of signigicant figures in a number.
b. Add two numbers and decide how many significant figures to output.
c. Subtract two numbers and decide how many significant figures to output.
d. Multiply two numbers and decide how many significant figures to output.
e. Divide two numbers and decide how many significant figures to output.
